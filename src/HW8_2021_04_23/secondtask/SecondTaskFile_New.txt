Wow.
Some funny story.
If you hit it into the woods, it makes a beeping sound level, if you hit it into the water it produces bubbles, and if you hit it on the fairway, smoke comes up in order for you to find it. The friend says, "Wow. That's incredible. Where did you get that ball."
It's too long story.
